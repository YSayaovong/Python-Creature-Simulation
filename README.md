# Python Creature Simulation

A Python-based software engineering project that simulates the behavior and interactions of a virtual "creature."  
This project was originally structured like a game but is designed to demonstrate **object-oriented programming, algorithmic design, and AI-inspired decision-making** in Python.

## üöÄ Features
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The creature is modeled with attributes such as health, energy, and actions.
- **Behavior Simulation**: The creature can perform activities like eating, moving, or resting, each impacting its internal state.
- **Rule-Based AI**: Decision-making logic determines the creature‚Äôs next action based on current conditions.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can modify attributes (energy consumption, recovery rate, etc.) to test different outcomes.
- **Console-Based Interface**: Simple, lightweight simulation without reliance on external graphics libraries.
